Project Overview

This project involves analyzing mRNA expression data to classify different sample types using machine learning models (k-NN and Logistic Regression) and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and t-SNE).
Files

    mRNA_Expression_ML_Analysis.ipynb: Contains the code for data analysis, model training, and dimensionality reduction.
    Data_Expression_mRNA_9classes.csv: The dataset used for the analysis (unable to upload due to file size limits).

Instructions

    Open the Jupyter Notebook.
    Note: The dataset (Data_Expression_mRNA_9classes.csv) was too large to upload. You can access the dataset from [external source link or description of where to find it].
    Run the cells to perform data exploration, dimensionality reduction, and model training.
